# How to play Zimon

## Select difficulty
After the game is loaded to your Nanobox the RGB-LED should be blue. The game starts in the level-select "menu". Press Button5 to select your difficulty, the options are:
- Easy: Indicated by the RGB-LED being blue, this is the default level the Nanobox starts into
- Normal: Indicated by green RGB-LED
- Hard: Indicated by yellow RGB-LED
- Master: Indicated by red RGB-LED

The effect of difficulty levels on the game is explained below. Once you selected your difficulty you can start the game by pressing Button6.

## Game
At the start of the game the Nanobox will light up one or more of the four colored LEDs (red, blue, yellow, or green). You have to remember the LEDs and press the buttons corresponding to that LED. You have to wait until the shown LEDs turn off, otherwise your input will not register with the Nanobox. If more than one LED was shown, you have to press all the corresponding buttons, in which order you have press them does not matter though. If your input was correct the Nanobox will immediately answer with the next LEDs that are added to the sequence. **It will not show you the beginning of the sequence again**, you have to remember with what the sequence started with! Now, you have to answer with the buttons that were asked of you before first and then add the newly shown LEDs at the end.

This series of events keeps repeating: The Nanobox shows you the newest set of LEDs to add to the sequence and you answer with the **full** sequence. If you keep up with Zimon, you win the game indicated by a happy blinking Nanobox. If you make a mistake or take too long to answer the Nanobox you lose and all 5 LEDs will flash angrily at you. In either case the Nanobox goes back into the difficulty select menu (see above).

## Difficulties
### Easy
Indicated by blue colored RGB-LED. Zimon will add 1 LED in each step to the sequence. The whole sequence will be 5 steps long. The LEDs show long and you have a lot of time to give your answers. 
### Normal
Indicated by green colored RGB-LED. Zimon still adds only 1 LED in each step, but you have to react a bit quicker. Also the whole sequence will be 7 steps long.
### Hard
Indicated by yellow colored RGB-LED. Zimon will add 2 LEDs in each step. The sequence is 10 steps long and you have to be fast. Zimon is not pulling any punches, this is indeed hard!
### Master
Indicated by red colored RGB-LED. Zimon will add 1, 2, or 3 LEDs in each step. The sequence is a whopping 15 steps long! Also you have to be very fast to answer Zimon. If you can beat Zimon on this level you are a true master in quick memorization and nimble fingers!
